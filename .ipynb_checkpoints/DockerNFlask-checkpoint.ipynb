    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello! You're looking at a guide and open source sample for Dockerized Flask apps on Azure. Specifically, we'll be using a combination of Python, the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure</a> Portal, and <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker</a>, to build and deploy a pre-packaged text summarization model via a <a href=\"http://flask.pocoo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Flask API</a>, running on a Linux image, in the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "In doing so, we'll set up a pipeline for continuous iteration and deployment of your model - whether it continues to use a package like Gensim to do the heavy lifting, or consists of a pickled custom TensorFlow, CNTK, or Torch model you wish to expose as a prediction endpoint. That's assuming you're doing machine learning - you can also use this sample to bootstrap whatever alternative Python code you might want to deploy as an API!\n",
    "\n",
    "As is common, it is in fact a simple process, but a poorly documented one in which your steps must be precise, and errors in the event of a misstep are often unhelpful. I'm here to help with that!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "> - If you are comfortable with the use and purpose of Flask and Docker and just looking for the exact steps to deployment, skip to Step 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "> - If you notice mistakes, details left out, are unsuccessful in using this guide, or wish to ask me a question, please go via the usual GitHub routes to request changes, or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/masoncusack\">Tweet me</a>."

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things you'll need to get set up to run and deploy this project:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Python 3 - download at https://python.org \n",
    " - <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/docker-windows\" target=\"_blank\">Docker for Windows</a> - OG Docker will work of course. If you are running Linux, you should be able to follow along. For Windows users, make sure Docker commands are working when executed in Powershell, as that is what we will use for building and pushing images for deployment.\n",
    " - An Azure subscription, <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/\" target=\"_blank\">get one (or start a free trial) here</a>.\n",
    " - A code editor (I recommend <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VS Code</a> nowadays).\n",
    " - A local git installation. <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Get git here</a>.\n",
    " - <a href=\"https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/\" target=\"_blank\">VSTS</a> and <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker Hub</a> accounts (GitHub also useable for source code, but VSTS will be used to track our builds on deployment) \n",
    " \n",
    "### Step 1: Cloning the project code and local setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you wish to use my text summarization example or not, it may help to use this code to bootstrap your Flask app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal (Powershell for example), navigate to a working directory, and enter `git clone https://github.com/masoncusack/gensimsummarizer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among many things, this will get you the source code in `/app`, which I at least know builds successfully with Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a `requirements.txt` file which contains everything you need to run the code. If wishing to run the Python code locally (before building with docker, which will do this for you), use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the `/app` directory in your favourite terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Incidentally, the `DOCKERFILE` inside the `/app` directory will do this automatically on local builds and first deployment, meaning the deployment of new functionalities can take a short time to kick in. We'll come back to that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, after some installs, you should now be set up to run the code locally."

    "### Step 2: Flask - What's in the code? (And how to run it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon opening `/app/app.py`, you should notice a few abnormalities when compared to your normal Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Python package like any other, Flask is quite easy to set up, and we do it here in a specific way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   from flask import Flask, jsonify, request \n",
    "   from flask_cors import CORS \n",
    "```\n",
    "The need for `import Flask` is obvious, but note that `jsonify` will be used to format the result we deliver to the caller of our API.\n",
    "\n",
    "`from flask_cors import CORS` is then used to enable `CORS(app)` on line 8. This is simply useful for testing, as it will allow calls to the API from all potential origins, including local development builds of frontend apps. Handy, but be aware that is a security risk in practice. You can <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS\" target=\"_blank\">learn more about it here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "`app = Flask(__name__)` is then simply the initialization of our app, before it is wrapped to allow cross-origin access.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Routes\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice from this point several \"routes\", which head functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/summary', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_summary():\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/keywords', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_keywords():\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have guessed, these define both the specific endpoints of our API, and the functions they run when called, thus we nest within these separate functions our various functionalities, in this case the return of a summarization of the given text, and keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling caller input\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each of these endpoint functions, we capture the input provided by the caller in the query string, anticipating it to be labelled 'text':\n",
    "\n",
    "```input_string = request.args.get('text')```\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid query string is thus constructed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```<domain-on-which-api-is-running>/<endpoint>?text=<content-for-which-we-desire-summarization-or-keywords>```\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of which endpoint is called in this case, the API takes the value of the input variable 'text' and uses it to compute a summary or keywords. Failure to provide an input labelled 'text' in the query string will result in a Bad Request error. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the following line in the main function:\n",
    "\n",
    "`app.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets the app up to run by default on the localhost address (127.0.0.1) of the system/image it's started on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the flask app locally using `export FLASK_APP=app.py` from within `/app`, and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see it in action (5000 is the default port).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note what is returned at this root endpoint, and what happens when you change the endpoint and provide an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the root endpoint `/`, you should get the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Hello, World! Try the endpoints /summary?text=<yourtext> or /keywords?text=<yourtext>`"
